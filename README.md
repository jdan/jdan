My name is [Jordan](https://jordanscales.com). I like science fiction, [writing](https://thatjdanisso.cool), theoretical computer science, [retro computing](https://jdan.github.io/98.css), silly [twitter](https://twitter.com/jdan) accounts, and try not to take myself too seriously.

I currently work at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), building internal tools to facilitate collaboration between my coworkers.
